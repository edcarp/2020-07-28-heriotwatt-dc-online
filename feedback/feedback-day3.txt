R Data Analysis


Keep:

     It is very helpful to have tutors tagging along the workshop to explain what went wrong in the error messages and offer additional advice, other than the instructor's teaching

     Thorough explanation on the details, short keys and varieties of a function

     
To improve:

     A bit confused on which conversation board to use (here or zoom?), could have make a fixed arragement perhaps?

Keep:

    Worked examples and exercises
                                     
    The presenters knowledge of the language is apparent, and I enjoy when they add their own opinions and tips as they are going through the workshop steps (so long as it doesn't delay the progress of the workshop).

     prompt and helpful answer in chat

     

To improve:

     Overall pace of delivery - slow at start then rushing through material at end so difficult to keep up and take in all information

    In this workshop I found the continued interruption of the presenter by one of the helpers distracting, appeared to disrupt the flow of the lesson, and was a little frustrating.

     What do we need to install for tomorrow's lesson? Is installing DB.Browser for SQLite is sufficient?
