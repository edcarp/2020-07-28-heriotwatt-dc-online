 Feedback 29.8.2020 R Intro

 Keep:

     focus on tidyverse functions

     Well explained in great details, I really enjoyed it!

     Thank you

     Well covered on multiple aspects

     Really thorough, lots to take in.



 To improve:

     good practice in R: copy and paste regularly rather than typing

     A little bit hard to follow at the very end, but that is understandable due to limited timing. 

    Some things were too obvious, could have used that time for more complex examples
